        This ESP32-controlled robot eats your phone for specified durations, in order to help you focus.
        Use the two potentiometers to dial in your desired focus time, put your phone in its mouth, close its mouth,
        and press its nose to start the timer.
        <br />
        If you try to open its mouth during focus time, FOCUSBOT will scream at you. You also can't access the
        inside of its mouth anyways!
        <br />
        Once focus time is up, FOCUSBOT will chirp to let you know time is up. You'll then be able to reach inside
        its mouth and retrieve your phone.
        <br />

        <span style="font-weight:bolder; font-size:20px">ARTISTIC VISION</span> <br />
        As I was thinking of a final project idea, I kept getting distracted by my phone instead of actually
        brainstorming ideas. I'll often throw my phone onto my bed to force myself to focus, and I wanted to
        implement some sort of physical barrier to make it even harder to get distracted. I also wanted to use
        a piezo buzzer and a light sensor, as I've never used those components before. Thus, I came up with the idea
        for a robot that physically blocks you from accessing your phone and also gets angry at you if you try
        to cheat.

        <span style="font-weight:bolder; font-size:20px">FABRICATION</span> <br />
        This project (like prev. projects) required some fancy LED wiring to connect the brow lights
        as one strip and the cheek lights as a second strip.
        <br />
        <br />
        <img src="images/panel-back.JPG" style="width: 75%; margin-left: 12.5%; margin-right: 12.5%"><br />
        <br />
        <br />
        I had some issues with the servo motor that rotates in a blocker during focus time - because
        the motor is relatively weak and the panel was unbalanced, it would sometimes shake uncontrollably
        when rotating into the unblocked position. I eventually solved this problem by placing a block on the
        right side to stabilize its final position.
        <br />
        <br />
        <img src="images/mouth.JPG" style="width: 75%; margin-left: 12.5%; margin-right: 12.5%"><br />
        <br />
        The rotating block also made it trickier to wire everything up on the inside, as I had to make sure
        the wires wouldn't get in the way. I made sure to push all the wires to the side as much as possible.

        <span style="font-weight:bolder; font-size:20px">CODE WALKTHROUGH</span> <br />
        I used the <code>TickTwo</code> library to handle the timed portion of FOCUSBOT,
        since it allows for parallel processing (or near enough), so the ESP32 can
        keep track of time elapsed, monitor light levels, and react to light all
        at the same time.
        <br />
        <br />
        The main loop is broken into two <code>if</code> branches: when the timer isn’t running, and when the timer is running.
        <br />
        <br />
        When the timer isn’t running, the ESP32 monitors potentiometer readings and updates the brow lights accordingly, using the <code>potLightUpdate()</code> function.
        <br />

        When the timer IS running, the ESP32 first checks whether the LDR senses light or not. If it does, it tells the piezo buzzer to start screaming, and also starts the alarm timer. It also monitors for when the LDR stops sensing light, in which case it silences the piezo and stops the alarm timer.

        After all these resets, the ESP32 also repolls the potentiometer settings (in case they were changed during focus time) and relights the brow LEDs accordingly, using the <code>relightPots()</code> function.
